PSRToolbox
==========

Collection of methods and tools for using PSRs to model dynamical systems and to construct model-based reinforcement learning algorithms. 
The PSR code optionally uses randomized compression techniques to increase performance (so called "Compressed Predictive State Representations"). 
For details see the README or refer to the paper "Efficient Learning and Planning with Compressed Predictive States" at arXiv:1312.0286 [cs.LG].
